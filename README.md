This project was created for Matthew Hayek's Environmental Quantitative Methods class in the spring 2024 semester at New York University.

It uses data from the Federal Aviation Administration's National Wildlife Strike Database at https://wildlife.faa.gov.

The file NWSD.csv is a CSV file of the database as modified for use in the project. It contains all reported incidents from the 50 U.S.
  states from 2014 through 2023 and excludes all others. It also includes only the variables for date, month, year, time of day, state,
  height (altitude), airport ID, latitude, and longitude.

The file NWSD202404.csv.zip is a compressed CSV file of the entire FAA NWSD, current through April 2024, that I used to create NWSD.csv.
